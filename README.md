# Fire-Fighting-Robot
Fire Fighting Robot is an equipment model used to detect and cease fires without involving humans into the scene. The basic operation of this robot is to seek the zone, find the fire and extinguish it before the situation turns out of control. 
Raspberry Pi controls the robot. Flame Sensor acts as the primary detector of the blaze. Temperature sensor records the temperature during the operation of the robot.
A buzzer is connected to alert the surrounding of fire; the GSM module sends an SMS alert to the concerned on occasion of fire.
A webcam mounted on a servomotor provides live footage of the surrounding. The pump motor, which sprays water, is activated as soon as the fire is detected.
